title: 3a. Installing a Mod
---
1. Download a DnDGMod-compatible mod ZIP, but **don't** extract the downloaded ZIP file. *Some examples of great D&DG mods include:*
	* [Balatro Mod by roaxial](https://gamebanana.com/mods/536043)
	* [More Mathematical Cards by nekojoe](https://gamebanana.com/mods/540940)
	* [Other Mods on GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/20462)
2. Open DnDGMod if you haven't already (if you still need to install DnDGMod, please view the [[Installing DnDGMod|DnDGMod Installation Instructions]]) and click "Load Mod".
3. In the file selector window that appears, select the mod ZIP you downloaded in step 1.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for as many mods as you want to install.
5. Your mods have now been installed, but they won't take effect yet; learn all about [[Compiling Modded D&DG]] to continue!
