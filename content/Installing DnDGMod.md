title: 2. Installing DnDGMod
---
1. Ensure you meet all of the [[Requirements for DnDGMod|DnDGMod Requirements]]
2. Download the [latest DnDGMod release from GitHub](https://github.com/DnDGMod/DnDGMod/releases/download/0.2.0-rc2/dndgmod-onefile-bundled.exe).
3. Run the downloaded EXE.
	**Q: It says "Windows protected your PC"?**
	A: This is due to the fact that it would cost me [$69/month](https://www.digicert.com/signing/code-signing-certificates#code_signing_key_locker) for a code signing certificate (for more information, please read [this StackOverflow answer on the topic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45316660/14212394)). To bypass this message, click "More Info", then click "Run Anyway". Frick you, Microsoft.
4. Click "Decompile D&DG" to decompile the game's source code. This process may take up to 5 minutes on your first run, and it may look frozen at parts but it most likely is not. **Only run "Decompile D&DG" on your first install of DnDGMod and after D&DG updates via Steam or issues may arise.**
5. You have now installed DnDGMod. Next, try [[Installing a Mod]], or if you're up for a challenge try your hand at [[Authoring a Mod]].
